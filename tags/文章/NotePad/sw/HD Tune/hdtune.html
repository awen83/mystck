HD Tune is a Hard Disk utility which has the following functions:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Benchmark: measures the performance</LI>
<LI>Info: shows detailed information</LI>
<LI>Health: checks the health status by using SMART</LI>
<LI>Error Scan: scans the surface for errors</LI>
<LI>Temperature display</LI>
</UL>

HD Tune may also work with other storage devices such as memory cards, USB sticks, iPods, etc.<BR><BR>

- Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows XP 64-bit, Windows 2003 Server (must be logged on as an administrator)<BR>
- 10 MB of free disk space<BR>
- a SCSI, SATA or IDE hard disk<BR><BR>

</TABLE><BR>

Using HD Tune is very easy.<BR>
First select the hard disk, then choose a function.<BR><BR>

<FONT size=+1>Benchmark</FONT><BR><BR>
<IMG src="HDTune_Benchmark.gif"><BR><BR>

After the Start button is pressed HD Tune will perform several tests to measure the performance of the hard disk.<BR><BR>

<U>Transfer Rate</U><BR>
The read speed is measured in megabytes per second (MB/sec). The minimum, maximum and average speed are displayed on the right. The blue line on the graph shows the read performance across the disk.<BR>
*note*: One megabyte equals to 1048576 bytes (=1024 kilobytes). Some benchmarks define one megabyte as 1000000 bytes which results in higher scores.<BR><BR>

In the options screen (press the <IMG src="HDTune_Options.gif"> button) you can select the test duration.<BR><BR>
<IMG src="HDTune_Options_Benchmark.gif"><BR><BR>

<U>Access Time</U><BR>
The average access time is measured and displayed in milli-seconds (ms). The measured access times are shown on the graph as the yellow dots.<BR><BR>

<U>Burst Rate</U><BR>
The burst rate is the highest speed (in megabytes per second) at which data can be transferred from the drive interface (IDE or SCSI for example) to the operating system.<BR><BR>

<U>CPU Usage</U><BR>
The CPU usage shows how much CPU time (in %) the system needs to read data from the hard disk.<BR><BR>

<FONT size=+1>Information</FONT><BR><BR>
<IMG src="HDTune_Info.gif"><BR><BR>

The first part of the screen shows detailed information about each partition on the hard disk.<BR><BR>
The second part shows which features are supported.<BR><BR>
The third part shows basic information.<BR>
- Firmware version<BR>
- Serial number<BR>
- Capacity<BR>
  <I>(The capacity between braces shows the capacity as it is marketed by the manufacturer; defining 1 KB as 1000 bytes)</I><BR>
- Buffer size<BR>
- Interface standard<BR>
- Maximum transfer mode and active transfer mode<BR><BR>

<FONT size=+1>Health</FONT><BR><BR>
<IMG src="HDTune_Health.gif"><BR><BR>

This function uses S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology) to get information about the health of the hard disk.<BR>
The table shows the following parameters:<BR>
- ID: parameter which is being measured<BR>
- Current: current value<BR>
- Worst: the worst value which has been recorded since the hard disk was first used<BR>
- Threshold: the value of any of the parameters should never get below the threshold.<BR>
- Data: shows the usable data which belongs to the ID.<BR>
- Status: status of the parameter (OK or failed).<BR><BR>

<U>Power on time</U><BR>
The power on time is usually indicated in hours, but some manufacturers show this time in minutes or even seconds.<BR><BR>

<FONT size=+1>Error Scan</FONT><BR><BR>
<IMG src="HDTune_ErrorScan.gif"><BR><BR>
By pressing the Start button the whole surface of the disk will be scanned for defects.<BR>
Defects will show up as red blocks.<BR><BR>

<FONT size=+1>Temperature</FONT><BR><BR>
The temperature is shown on the main screen and on the taskbar.<BR>
In the options screen you can select the temperature units (Celsius or Fahrenheit) and whether the temperature should be shown in the taskbar.<BR><BR>
<IMG src="HDTune_Options_Temperature.gif"><BR><BR>
You can also specify the critical temperature value. If this value is reached the font color changes and a warning message pops up.<BR><BR>
<IMG src="HDTune_Taskbar.gif"><BR><BR>
For good operation the temperature should stay below 50 °C. The temperature should never exceed 60 °C.<BR><BR>
*note*: not all drives can report the temperature.<BR><BR>

The General page in the options window has a few options which are useful to monitor hard disk temperature with HD Tune.<BR><BR>
<IMG src="HDTune_Options_General.gif"><BR><BR>
Start minimized: HD Tune will be minimized to the taskbar. To open HD Tune, doubleclick on the temperature display or right-click to bring up a menu.<BR>
*note*: the 'Show temperature in taskbar' option must be enabled.<BR>
To minimize HD Tune to the taskbar when HD Tune is open you can press the <IMG src="HDTune_Minimize.gif"> button on the title bar.<BR><BR>


Run at startup: starts HD Tune each time Windows is started.<BR><BR>

You can save the output to a file or copy the output to the clipboard.<BR><BR>

<IMG src="HDTune_SaveScreen.gif"> Save screenshot. The screenshot will be saved in the PNG format to a folder of your choice.<BR>
*note* under Windows 2000 you have to download and install the GDI+ library file which can be found on the Microsoft download site (look for gdiplus.dll).<BR><BR>

<IMG src="HDTune_CopyText.gif"> Copy information to clipboard as text.<BR>
You can use a text editor to paste the information into a document.<BR><BR>

<IMG src="HDTune_CopyScreen.gif"> Copy screenshot to clipboard.<BR>
You can paste a screenshot into a picture editor.<BR><BR>
